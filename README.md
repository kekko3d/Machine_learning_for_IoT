# ***Machine Learning for IoT***

This repository contains all the assignments from the course **[Machine Learning for IoT](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TXPSM&p_a_acc=2023&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N)**. 

The course aims to introduce the problems related to the implementation of machine learning applications and algorithms on platforms other than high-performance servers available in the cloud. 

The course topics are organized in three main parts:
1. Internet-of-Things,
2. Machine and Deep Learning in the IoT,
3. Data exchange.

Technologies adopted: `Tensorflow`, `Pytorch`, `Keras`, `CherryPy`
