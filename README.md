# ***Machine Learning for IoT***

This repository contains all the assignments from the course **[Machine Learning for IoT](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TXPSM&p_a_acc=2023&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N)**. 

The course aims to introduce the problems related to the implementation of machine learning applications and algorithms on platforms other than high-performance servers available in the cloud. 

Course Topics:

● Hardware:
 - Computer architectures used for running and developing "edge" machine learning algorithms.
 - "quantitative" analysis between single/multi-core microprocessors, microcontrollers, DSP, PLC, GPU, etc.
 - Basic knowledge about sensors: filtering, conversion
 - understanding, modeling and optimization of non-functional metrics (energy, performance)

● Software:
 - real problems in IT-industrial applications
 - machine-learning algorithms
 - Distributed software for edge computing
 - Event processing / sensor fusion
 - Management of edge-fog-cloud interfaces (web programming/network programming of IoT protocols - REST response and Publish subscribe)
 - Microservices design patterns
 - Cloud/edge workload balancing

Technologies adopted: `Tensorflow`, `Pytorch`, `Keras`, `CherryPy`

### Homeworks
|HW1| VAD Optimization and Memory Constraint Time-Series Processing

|HW2| Human voice analysis for detecting go/stop words in order to create a voice recognition system

|HW3| Data Collection, Communication and Storage
